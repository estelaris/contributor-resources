## Icons in Lesson Plans
The Make site had the ability to add alert boxes to lesson plans. We have lost that in the move to GitHub. However, we have chosen to use icons as a replacement.

The alert boxes in Make, which when migrated appear as shortcodes, should be converted as follows:
* [info] 		  ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wptrainingteam/contributor-resources/master/images/info.png)
* [tip]       ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wptrainingteam/contributor-resources/master/images/lightbulb.png)
* [alert] 	  ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wptrainingteam/contributor-resources/master/images/flag.png)
* [warning] 	![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wptrainingteam/contributor-resources/master/images/dismiss.png)

To use these icons in Markdown for any lesson plan here on GitHub, copy and paste these links (including the blockquote marker) into the lesson plans:
```

> ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wptrainingteam/contributor-resources/master/images/lightbulb.png)
> ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wptrainingteam/contributor-resources/master/images/flag.png)
> ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wptrainingteam/contributor-resources/master/images/dismiss.png)
```
